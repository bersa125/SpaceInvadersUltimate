# Space Invaders Ultimate 

A 3D arcade game based on the popular vintage game "Space Invaders" developed Three.js using the MVC architectural pattern, taking as hint [THREE.JS MVC Example](https://github.com/lucasmajerowicz/threejs-mvc-example) of lucasmajerowicz and having as skeleton the [Three.js bolierplate](https://github.com/learnthreejs/three-js-boilerplate).

## Getting Started
The steps needed to make it working are the same of the previous linked Three.js boilerplate:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:8080
