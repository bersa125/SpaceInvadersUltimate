# Space Invaders Ultimate 

A 3D arcade game based on the popular vintage game "Space Invaders" developed Three.js using the MVC architectural pattern, taking as hint [THREE.JS MVC Example](https://github.com/lucasmajerowicz/threejs-mvc-example) of lucasmajerowicz and having as skeleton the [Three.js bolierplate](https://github.com/learnthreejs/three-js-boilerplate).

## Getting Started
The steps needed to make it working locally are the same done in case of launching a web application, for example with a python 3.6 web server:

```bash
$ python -m http.server 8080
```

Open http://localhost:8080

## Example
You can see how it works at this address: https://federicoalfano.github.io/SpaceInvadersUltimate/

### Test
The compatibility at the moment is well-tested only on the Chrome browser
